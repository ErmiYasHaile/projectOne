# Countries API

# Description
- This is a web application designed to help users search for country information such as the capital city, country code, population, currencies, and region. The website is built using CSS, HTML, and Javascript, and relies on a third-party API to display search results.


- During the development process, I faced some challenges with integrating the API on the client side. However, after conducting thorough research, I was able to successfully implement the API and achieve the desired search results. 

- Moving forward, I plan to incorporate additional features such as a map, search history, and a list feature to further enhance the user experience.

# How to use the project

- This project used API that can be accessed through a [LIVE](https://countryspotter.netlify.app/) link that will redirect you to the website where it has been deployed on Netlify. Once you're there, you can search for any country you're interested in and view the information related to it on the front page.
